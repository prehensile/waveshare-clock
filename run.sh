# Experimental modification of LUT tables that form waveforms that refresh "pixels" - implemented only for 2.7" displays.
# This modification makes refresh about 10 times faster for black die, and 2-3 times faster for red die. This of course has
# consequences in not-so ideal refresh and with time some random artifacts may start to build up. To recover you would need
# to turn this feature off for some time until original LUT tables won't remove those artifacts.
# Enable this feature on your own responsibility!
